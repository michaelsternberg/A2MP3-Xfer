A disk utility for Apple II users who own an A2MP3 card from Briel Computers.  Allows a physical DOS 3.3 diskette to be transferred to a .DSK disk image file on a USB thumbdrive mounted on the A2MP3 card.

Current limitations:
* DOS 3.3 only (no PRODOS or copy-protected diskettes)
* Floppy to USB only (USB to Floppy under development)
* A2MP3 in Slot 3 only
* Floppy in Slot 6 Drive 1 only
* No validation (Currently operates in "hope for the best" mode)
* Use at own risk - Do not try with any diskettes precious to you
